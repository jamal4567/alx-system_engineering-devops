# Postmortem: August 2024 Web Service Outage

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** August 12, 2024, 15:00 - 17:30 GMT+1 (2 hours, 30 minutes)
- **Impact:** The primary web service was unavailable, leading to a 60% reduction in traffic and preventing 75% of users from accessing the website. Users experienced timeouts and 502 Bad Gateway errors when attempting to load the site.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer caused a bottleneck, leading to server overload and service unavailability.

## Timeline

- **15:00 GMT+1:** I detected the issue via a monitoring alert indicating high error rates and reduced traffic.
- **15:05 GMT+1:** I began the initial investigation, suspecting a network issue due to the nature of the 502 errors.
- **15:15 GMT+1:** I checked the network infrastructure and found no issues. I then shifted my focus to potential database latency problems.
- **15:30 GMT+1:** The database team confirmed that there were no issues with database performance or connectivity.
- **15:45 GMT+1:** I escalated the investigation to the DevOps team and started reviewing recent deployment logs for any potential misconfigurations.
- **16:00 GMT+1:** I identified a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer as the likely root cause. A recent update had incorrectly routed traffic, leading to server overload.
- **16:15 GMT+1:** I rolled back the Nginx configuration to the previous stable version.
- **16:30 GMT+1:** I restarted the load balancer, and service started to recover. My monitoring showed a gradual reduction in error rates.
- **17:00 GMT+1:** Full service was restored, and traffic levels returned to normal.
- **17:30 GMT+1:** After final checks confirmed stability, I officially closed the incident.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer. A recent update, which was intended to improve traffic distribution, inadvertently introduced a faulty configuration. This error caused the load balancer to route all incoming traffic to a single server, which quickly became overwhelmed and led to widespread service failures.

To resolve the issue, I rolled back the Nginx configuration to a previous stable version. After restarting the load balancer, traffic was redistributed evenly across all servers. I monitored the situation closely and confirmed that error rates had dropped and normal service had resumed.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, I will take the following actions:

- **Configuration Review Process:** I will implement a stricter review process for changes to load balancer configurations, including peer reviews and automated configuration checks before deployment.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** I will add specific monitoring on the load balancer to detect and alert on traffic distribution anomalies immediately.
- **Disaster Recovery Testing:** I will conduct regular failover and load testing to ensure systems can handle misconfigurations without leading to service outages.
- **Documentation Update:** I will update the deployment procedures with a detailed rollback plan and a checklist for verifying load balancer configurations.

### TODO

1. Implement automated tests for Nginx configuration changes.
2. Set up alerts for any single server handling more than 30% of total traffic.
3. Document and train the team on new review processes and rollback procedures.
4. Schedule quarterly disaster recovery drills to ensure the team is prepared for similar incidents.

## Conclusion

This outage highlighted the critical importance of thorough testing and peer review processes in managing infrastructure changes. While the immediate issue was resolved relatively quickly, the incident underscores the need for continuous improvement in my deployment and monitoring practices. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, I aim to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and strengthen the resilience of my services.

The lessons learned from this outage will not only improve my technical processes but also enhance my preparedness to respond to future challenges effectively. Moving forward, I am committed to fostering a culture of proactive problem-solving and continuous learning to ensure the reliability and stability of my platform.
